Collections Framework in Java:
collection of classes that help us manage and manipulate data in a better way
1)ArrayList
    1)This class has many built-in methods like add() remove() clear() etc.
    2) Dynamic and can adjust their size at run time

ArrayList<> arrayList=new ArrayList<>();
ArrayList=> name of the class
<> =>diamond operator we specify the data type
Wrapper classes
byte=>Byte
short=Short
int=Integer
double=Double
char=character

why wrapper classes
1) we get built-in methods
2) a lot of frameworks do not support primitives
when to use primitive:
 1)When we care about the memory because primitives occupy 4 times less memory as compared to wrapper
 2) performance
 When to use Wrapper
 When we care about our ease
