Set in java:
    set is an interface in collections framework which is implemented by many classes for
    example Hashset,LinkedHashSet and TReeHashSEt
Properties of Set:
All the sets do not allow duplicates.
Hashset:
    1)HashSet does not maintain the insertion order
    2)it is the fastest in all Sets
    3) Most widely used in Set.
LinkedHashSet:
    1) Maintain the insertion order
    2)slower than HashSet but faster than TreeSet specially in the insertions
TreeSet:
    1) Sorts the data in natural order. For number in increasing order
    2) it is the slowest when it comes to store the dat.
When to use which type of Set:
    1) If we do not care about insertion order and data being sorted always use the HashSet
    2) if we need the insertion order we do not have much choice we have to use the LinkedHashSet
    but if we do not care about the insertion order we can compare with TreeSet
    LinkedHashSet               vs                  TreeSet
    Insertion is not slow                           Slowest insertion
    Retrieval is super super slow                   slower than HashSet but faster than linkedHashSet
I do not care about insertion order but I care about retrieval speed which Set should I use?
HashSet
I care about insertion order but I do not care about retrieval speed which Set should I use?
LinkedHashSet.
If I want to have sorted data all the time?
TreeSet
